# Non-contact-estimation-of-Blood-Pressure-measurement-using-facial-videos
We have developed a cuffless, non-contact measurement of blood pressure measurement technique that uses facial videos of the patient obtained from a regular smartphone. It is based on remote PPG (Polyplethysmography) technique. Leveraging features extracted from the PPG signal, an individualâ€™s BP can be estimated. Experiments were performed on 15 human participants under different lighting and environmental conditions. The experiment protocol involved different physical activities given as tasks with an appropriate buffering period. The PPG signal was extracted from the facial video of the subjects and systolic peaks, diastolic peaks, and IBI values were calculated from it. A regression model was used to prove the correlation between IBI values and BP. The proposed technique can be easily extended to the camera on any mobile phone and thus can be used widely in an extensive manner.
